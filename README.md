## Profile

I am a first year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of [Prof. Robert W. Heath Jr.](http://www.profheath.org/) and [Prof. Haris Vikalo](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~hvikalo/index.html). I am a member of the a member of the Wireless Networking and Communications Group ([WNCG](https://wncg.org/)) interested in the theoretical problems in the intersection of machine learning, communications and sensing, with real world applications, particularly to autonomous systems.

## Experience
I completed my B.S. in Mathematics from [Universidad de Los Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co/en) in 2015 in Colombia where  I worked on Monte Carlo methods for hypothesis testing on contingency tables under the supervision of [Prof. Mauricio Velasco](http://wwwprof.uniandes.edu.co/~mvelasco/Velasco.html). Afterwards, I had the chance to work with Google LA through the [Research for industrial Problems for Students](http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/student-research-programs/research-in-industrial-projects-for-students-rips-2018/?tab=overview) program at UCLA, and later as a data science researcher for industry and government projects at [Quantil](http://quantil.co/).

At UT Austin I was a TA for the [Data Science Lab](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dimakis/DataScienceLab.html) undergraduate course. 



### Research

Collaborative Sensing

Channel EStimation
link adaptation
Beam Training

*#### QuantilI Investigated Natural Language Processing techniques for Colombia's peace treaty and collaborated in the development of  [this site](http://www.acuerdosdepaz.co/). I also worked on comparing different crime prediction models for the Secretary of Security of Bogotá, Colombia.

* #### Exploiting geographic and business type diversity for recommender systems

University of California, Los Angeles, [Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics](www.ipam.ucla.edu).  I was a participant of [RIPS LA](http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/student-research-programs/research-in-industrial-projects-for-students-rips-2018/?tab=overview), a research program for undergraduate students in industrial problems. The project, sponsored by Google LA, explored recommender systems using the Yelp Challenge Dataset and focused on recommender systems using optimization techniques and natural language processing. 


* #### Undergraduate thesis: Sampling lattice points from polytopes. 
Advisor: Mauricio Velasco. We considered a new algorithmto sample from a discrete set by sampling from a convex continuous set and using aneffective ?rounding? to obtain integer points from the lattice. This problem has application insampling contingency tables for hypothesis testing.
* #### Portfolio Optimization in the Colombian Stock Market
